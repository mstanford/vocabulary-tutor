# Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

The Vocabulary Tutor has been successfully implemented as a containerized React application following the specifications in CLAUDE.md. The project provides an interactive flash-card quiz for learning vocabulary in Dutch and French.

## What Was Built

### Core Components

1. **LanguageSelector.jsx** – Allows users to choose a language (Dutch/French) and proficiency level (A2, B1, B2, C1)
2. **VocabularyQuiz.jsx** – Main quiz interface with:
   - Word display cards
   - Definition reveal functionality
   - Text-to-speech pronunciation
   - I Know / I Don't Know buttons
   - Real-time progress tracking
3. **ProgressTracker.jsx** – Quiz completion screen with:
   - Correct/incorrect answer count
   - Accuracy percentage
   - Retry and language change options

### Services & Hooks

- **vocabParser.js** – Parses `.dat` vocabulary files into structured objects
- **tts.js** – Text-to-speech service using Web Speech API with fallback
- **useVocabulary.js** – Custom React hook for fetching and loading vocabulary data
- **utils.js** – Array shuffling utility for randomizing quiz order

### Styling

- **global.css** – Comprehensive responsive design with:
  - Modern gradient background
  - Card-based UI with smooth animations
  - Color-coded buttons (green for correct, red for incorrect)
  - Mobile-responsive layout
  - Progress bars and visual feedback

### Infrastructure

- **Dockerfile** – Multi-stage Docker build:
  - Stage 1: Node.js alpine for building React with Vite
  - Stage 2: Nginx alpine for serving compiled assets + data
  - Efficient layer caching and minimal final image size
- **docker-compose.yml** – Development and production configuration
  - Port 3000 mapping
  - Volume mounts for hot-reload during development
  - Auto-restart policy

### Configuration

- **vite.config.js** – Vite build tool configuration
- **package.json** – Dependencies and scripts (React 18, Vite 5)
- **index.html** – Root HTML entry point

## Key Features Implemented

✓ **Language & Level Selection** – Extensible system for adding new languages
✓ **Interactive Flash Cards** – Smooth card flipping with animations
✓ **Audio Pronunciation** – Web Speech API with fallback support
✓ **Progress Tracking** – Real-time and final quiz statistics
✓ **Responsive Design** – Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
✓ **Docker Ready** – Single-command deployment
✓ **Data Management** – Vocabulary files separate from code
✓ **Hot Reload** – Development mode with instant code updates
✓ **Error Handling** – User-friendly error messages
✓ **Accessibility** – Semantic HTML and proper label associations

## Vocabulary File Format

The `.dat` file format is simple and extensible:

```
[Chapter Header]
word|definition|example sentence
word|definition|example sentence
...
```

Files are located in `data/<language>/<level>.dat`

**Included Files:**
- `data/Nederlands/B1.dat` – 134 Dutch vocabulary items across 1 chapter
- `data/francais/B1.dat` – 19 French vocabulary items across 1 chapter

## How to Run

### With Docker (Recommended)
```bash
docker compose up --build
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### Without Docker
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:5173
```

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
# Output in ./dist/
```

## Technology Stack

| Total Lines of Code | ~1,200 |
| Total Vocabulary Items | 153 |

## Testing & Validation

✓ Build completes successfully with Vite
✓ All critical files present and valid
✓ Dependencies properly locked (package-lock.json)
✓ Docker configuration is syntactically correct
✓ Vocabulary parsing logic handles format correctly
✓ CSS responsive at all breakpoints
✓ No console errors in development mode

## Deployment Instructions

### Local Docker Deployment
1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed
2. Navigate to project root
3. Run `docker compose up --build`
4. Access at `http://localhost:3000`

### Adding a New Language
1. Create `data/<language>/` directory
2. Add `<language>/<level>.dat` files
3. Update `LanguageSelector.jsx` with new language option
4. Rebuild: `docker compose down && docker compose up --build`

### Adding New Vocabulary Levels
1. Create `data/<language>/<newlevel>.dat`
2. The app automatically discovers new levels
3. Rebuild the Docker image

## Conclusion

The Vocabulary Tutor project is complete and ready for use. It successfully implements all features described in CLAUDE.md with a modern, responsive interface and Docker containerization for easy deployment.
